Financial Health Dashboard 

📋 Project Overview
This project involved developing a monthly-level interactive Power BI dashboard for The Financial dashboard. The goal was to provide leadership with a centralized tool to monitor the company’s financial health, track key KPIs, and analyze performance across different regions and product lines.


❗ Problem Statement
The client required a way to visualize complex financial data, including P&L, Cash Flow, and Budget vs. Actuals, which were previously siloed. The business needed to:


Identify underperforming regions or months.

Monitor liquidity and cash flow trends.


Track profitability metrics like EBITDA % and Gross Margin %.

Manage Receivables Aging to improve collections.


🛠️ Logic & Methodology
The development followed a rigorous data analysis workflow:


Data Cleaning: Verified dataset consistency and standardized date formats to enable Time Intelligence functions (YTD, YoY).


DAX Calculations: Utilized the DIVIDE function for key metrics like EBITDA % and Gross Margin % to ensure error-free calculations.


Aging Analysis: Averaged receivables across regions to pinpoint slow collection cycles.


Interactivity: Implemented time-period selectors, regional filters, and drill-down capabilities for granular data exploration.


📊 Key Insights

Budget Performance: Comparison of Revenue vs. Revenue Budget highlights specific periods of underperformance.


Liquidity Tracking: The Net Cash metric (Inflows - Outflows) provides a clear view of the company’s cash position. A negative month signals a need for tighter expense control.



Profitability Trends: Trend lines indicate whether growth in Revenue is scaling with Gross Profit or if COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) is rising too rapidly.


Collection Bottlenecks: Regional aging analysis reveals where the company's cash is tied up in receivables.

💡 Recommendations

Expense Control: In months showing negative Net Cash, management should prioritize immediate expense reduction or accelerate collection efforts.


COGS Management: If trend lines show COGS rising faster than revenue, a review of supplier costs or production efficiency is recommended.


Regional Focus: Target underperforming regions identified by the Budget vs. Actual variance for strategic intervention.
